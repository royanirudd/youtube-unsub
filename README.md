# YouTube Bulk Unsubscribe Helper

This browser extension provides a user interface to bulk-unsubscribe or selectively-unsubscribe from multiple YouTube channels at once from your subscriptions page.

It is a **helper script** designed to automate the process of clicking the unsubscribe buttons for you, saving you from having to do it one by one.

---

## **IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT: Dependency**

This extension **does not work on its own**. It is designed to work as a companion to the **"Easy Youtube Unsubscribe"** Firefox Add-on. You **MUST** have this other add-on installed and enabled for this tool to function.

**Why?** The "Easy Youtube Unsubscribe" add-on does the hard work of providing a simple, one-click unsubscribe button for each channel. This helper script simply provides a user interface to automate clicking those buttons in bulk.

**➡️ [Install "Easy Youtube Unsubscribe" from the Firefox Add-on Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/easy-youtube-unsubscribe/)**

## Installation

Since this is a helper script and not on the official Add-on store, you need to load it into Firefox manually.

1.  **Download the Code:** Download the project files from this GitHub repository. You can do this by clicking the green "Code" button and then "Download ZIP". Unzip the downloaded file to a folder on your computer.

2.  **Open Firefox Debugging:** Open a new tab in Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging`.

3.  **Go to "This Firefox":** In the left-hand menu, click on "This Firefox".

4.  **Load the Add-on:** Click the **"Load Temporary Add-on..."** button.

5.  **Select the Manifest File:** Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the project files and select the `manifest.json` file.

The extension is now temporarily installed and will remain active until you close Firefox. You will need to repeat these steps each time you restart the browser.

## How to Use

1.  Make sure both this add-on and the required "Easy Youtube Unsubscribe" add-on are installed and enabled.
2.  Navigate to your YouTube subscriptions page: [https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels](https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels)
3.  A new control panel for the "Subscription Manager" will appear on the top-right of the page.
4.  Use the "Selective Unsubscribe" button to choose specific channels or "Bulk Unsubscribe All" to start the process for every channel on the page.
